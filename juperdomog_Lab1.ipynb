Now, knowing whether your array contains `nan` values is all well and good, but how do we remove `nan`s? Handily enough, NumPy arrays can be indexed by boolean values (`True` or `False`). If we use a boolean array to index an array, we will remove all values of the array that register as `False` under the condition.

Linear algebra comes down to the multiplication and composition of scalar and matrix values. A scalar value is just a real number that we multiply against an array. When we scale a matrix or array using a scalar, we multiply each individual element of that matrix or array by the scalar.\n","\n","A matrix is a collection of values, typically represented by an $m \\times n$ grid, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. The edge lengths $m$ and $n$ do not necessarily have to be different. If we have $m = n$, we call this a square matrix. A particularly interesting case of a matrix is when $m = 1$ or $n = 1$. In this case we have a special case of a matrix that we call a vector. While there is a matrix object in NumPy we will be doing everything using NumPy arrays because they can have dimensions greater than $2$. For the purpose of this section, we will be using matrix and array interchangeably.\n","\n","We can express the matrix equation as:\n","\n","$$ y = A\\cdot x $$\n","\n","Where $A$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix, $y$ is a $m \\times 1$ vector, and $x$ is a $n \\times 1$ vector.

This requires a little bit more clarification, lest we think that we can go about multiplying any matrices by any other matrices.\n","\n","#### Matrix multiplication\n","\n","With matrix multiplication, the order in which the matrices are multiplied matters.
